### Format on Save

We have configuration in place to format our C# code on save. If this does not work for you, check your VS Code settings:

1. Go to Settings (the Keyboard shortcut for this is `Command` `,` for Mac users, and `Ctrl` `,` for Windows users. It can also be accessed through `File->Preferences->Settings`, or something similar)
2. Search for "Format on Save", and check the box.
